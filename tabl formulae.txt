1.No Of Orders (count)

COUNTD([Order ID])


Dynamic : It should be flexible and work for all


2. For dynamic measure (means if we selected proft then chart will show for profit)
	1st create parameter  FOR SALES , PROFIT , SHIPPING COST 
	
	then create calculated filed (show dynamic measure)
		IF [Dynamic Measures]="Sales" THEN [Sales]
		ELSEIF [Dynamic Measures]="Profit" THEN [Profit]
		ELSEIF [Dynamic Measures]="Shipping Cost" THEN [Shipping Cost]
		ELSE [Quantity]
		END

dynamic dimension is for label for column and dynamic measure is for to use value in table 

we make dynamic dimention for category,subcategory.segment,ship mode,	


3.Dynamic dimention (FOR CATEGORY AND SUBCATEGORY SEGMENT SUCH THINGS
	create dynamic parameter
		crate calculated field :
			IF [Dynamic Dimensions]="Category" THEN [Category]
			ELSEIF [Dynamic Dimensions]="Segment" THEN [Segment]
			ELSEIF [Dynamic Dimensions]="Region" THEN [Region]
			ELSEIF [Dynamic Dimensions]="Sub-Category" THEN [Sub-Category]
			ELSEIF [Dynamic Dimensions]="Order Priority" THEN [Order Priority]
			ELSE [Ship Mode]
			END 

4.Count:
	
	Dynamic Count Paramter:
			use NO of orders , No of customer, No of Products
	
	Create field (show dynamic count)
		
			
			IF [Dynamic Count]="Number of Orders" THEN [Number of Orders]
			ELSEIF [Dynamic Count]="No of Customers" THEN [No of Customers]
			ELSE [No of Products]
			END


5.No of days to ship:
	
	DATEDIFF('day',[Order Date],[Ship Date])



6.Ship Status:( to use in filter)

	if ATTR([No of Days to ship])>=5 
	THEN "Delayed"
	ELSEIF ATTR([No of Days to ship])>=2 AND ATTR([No of Days to ship])<=4
	THEN "Slight Delay"
	ELSE  "No Delay"
	END


7.No of Critical Orders

	COUNTD(IF [Order Priority]="Critical" then [Order ID] END)



8.No of Losses:
	COUNT(IF  [Profit_Status]= "Loss" THEN 1 END)



9.No of Delays:
	COUNTD(IF [No of Days to ship]>=5 THEN [Order ID] END)


10.No of Customers
	COUNTD([Customer ID])


11.No of Products:
	COUNTD([Product ID])

12,Shipping Cost Between:

	SUM([Shipping Cost])>=75000 AND SUM([Shipping Cost])<=125000


13.Dynamic Count
	IF [Dynamic Count]="Number of Orders" THEN [Number of Orders]
	ELSEIF [Dynamic Count]="No of Customers" THEN [No of Customers]
	ELSE [No of Products]
	END
